              <p className="mb-4">
                At Zafeguard, we believe that everyone deserves access to secure, user-friendly cryptocurrency
                management. Our mission is to eliminate the trade-off between security and usability that has plagued
                the crypto industry for years. We're building the future of digital asset protection through innovative
                Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology that keeps your crypto safe without sacrificing convenience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Founded by a team of cryptography experts and blockchain veterans, Zafeguard was born from the
                frustration of watching countless users lose their digital assets due to inadequate security measures.
                We set out to create a solution that would protect users from the most common causes of crypto loss:
                device theft, hacking, and human error.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Our Technology</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Zafeguard's dual-app architecture represents a breakthrough in cryptocurrency security. Our system
                consists of two complementary applications: Zafeguard Wallet for everyday crypto management and
                Zafeguard Vault for secure key storage and transaction authorization.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                At the heart of our technology is Multi-Party Computation (MPC), a cryptographic protocol that allows
                multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. In
                practical terms, this means your private keys are never stored in one place or reconstructed during
                transactions, making them virtually impossible to steal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our MPC implementation supports multiple elliptic curves including SECP256k1 (Bitcoin/Ethereum), ED25519
                (Solana), and NIST curves (P-256, P-384, P-512), ensuring compatibility with virtually every blockchain
                network while maintaining the highest security standards.
